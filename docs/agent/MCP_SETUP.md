# MCP Setup

QuantDinger's MCP server wraps the Agent Gateway and keeps the REST API as the source of truth.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e ./mcp_server
```

Set these environment variables in the MCP client process:

```text
QUANTDINGER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888
QUANTDINGER_AGENT_TOKEN=qd_agent_xxx
```

Run `quantdinger-mcp` for the default `stdio` transport. For network use, set `QUANTDINGER_MCP_TRANSPORT=sse` or `streamable-http`, plus optional `QUANTDINGER_MCP_HOST` and `QUANTDINGER_MCP_PORT`.

## Client configuration

A typical stdio client entry is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quantdinger": {
      "command": "quantdinger-mcp",
      "env": {
        "QUANTDINGER_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "QUANTDINGER_AGENT_TOKEN": "qd_agent_xxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Keep the configuration private. Prefer an environment-secret facility when the client supports one.

## Expected workflow

- Use market tools for discovery and OHLCV reads.
- Use indicator tools only for chart artifacts.
- Use Strategy API V2 code for backtests.
- Create deployments from saved V2 source IDs.
- Use bounded job polling or SSE streaming for backtest results.
- Require explicit confirmation before stopping runtime state or placing any order.

The strategy manifest owns market, instrument, frequency, warmup, dependency, and leverage scope. Do not pass those as alternate backtest fields.

For the exact tool signatures, see [the MCP package README](../../mcp_server/README.md) and [Agent OpenAPI](agent-openapi.json).
