# Agent Gateway Quickstart

QuantDinger exposes a tenant-scoped Agent Gateway at `/api/agent/v1`. Agent tokens are separate from human JWT sessions and enforce capability scopes, market/instrument allowlists, rate limits, expiry, and paper-only restrictions.

The machine-readable contract is [agent-openapi.json](agent-openapi.json). MCP setup is documented in [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md).

## Authenticate

Create an Agent Token from the human admin UI, store the full token when it is shown once, and send it as a bearer token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $QUANTDINGER_AGENT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8888/api/agent/v1/whoami
```

Scopes are `R` for reads, `W` for saved artifacts and deployment configuration, `B` for backtests, and `T` for runtime or order mutations. Token permissions never bypass server-side live-trading controls.

## Strategy API V2

Executable strategies use Strategy API V2. Code defines `initialize(context)`, declares its universe and subscriptions, and provides `handle_data`, `on_rebalance`, or a scheduled callback. Markets, instruments, frequencies, dependencies, warmup, and leverage policy come from the compiled manifest.

Create a stopped deployment from a saved source:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/agent/v1/strategies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $QUANTDINGER_AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "spy-trend",
    "sourceId": 12,
    "initialCapital": 10000,
    "executionMode": "signal",
    "leverageEnabled": false,
    "params": {"lookback": 50}
  }'
```

Update the same canonical fields with `PATCH /api/agent/v1/strategies/{id}`. Starting a deployment is intentionally not part of the W-scope configuration endpoint. A T-scope token can stop a running deployment through `/strategies/{id}/stop`.

## Backtests

Backtests accept Strategy API V2 code and run asynchronously:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/agent/v1/backtest/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $QUANTDINGER_AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: spy-trend-2025" \
  -d '{
    "code": "def initialize(context):\n    g.symbol = \"USStock:SPY\"\n    context.set_universe([g.symbol])\n    context.subscribe(frequency=\"1d\")\n\ndef handle_data(context, data):\n    pass",
    "startDate": "2025-01-01",
    "endDate": "2025-12-31",
    "initialCapital": 10000,
    "leverageEnabled": false,
    "params": {}
  }'
```

Poll `/api/agent/v1/jobs/{job_id}` or consume `/api/agent/v1/jobs/{job_id}/stream`. Reuse an idempotency key when retrying the same submission.

## Indicators

Indicators are chart-only. Fetch `/indicators/authoring-contract`, validate with `/indicators/validate`, and save through `/indicators`. Indicator code cannot be passed to the backtest endpoint; convert the trading idea to Strategy API V2 first.

## Runtime and orders

`GET /runtime/overview` returns compact tenant runtime state. Quick orders require T scope and an `Idempotency-Key`. Live execution additionally requires a live-capable token, server live-trading enablement, a credential reference, and client-side explicit confirmation when using MCP.

Never log tokens or credential material. Treat redacted values as terminal and do not attempt to reconstruct them.
